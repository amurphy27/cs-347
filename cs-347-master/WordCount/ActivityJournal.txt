Start
Estimated Time	8H 0M
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Begin by looking at getchar documentation since I know that it will be important for this assignment.
Next look into how to use getchar on the text file provided.
Then its just counting up characters.
 
Complete
Actual Time	4H 0M
Observations:
I was honestly expecting this to take longer after the c review and was expecting iterate a pointer to
the current character like in the c review. However, getchar made this easy once I learned how it worked
and remembered that I have to check if the previous charcter was a white space to add a word.
