Read  through the intro pdf, read the read me, go through the given code, look into additional resources if needed and then begin implementing code

Actual Time	11H 0M
Observations:
This assignment took me a little while to get used to using pointers and such but, the typo with in the main held me back for a good while. After that
I got things rolling but then ran into the issue of getting all the functions to actually talk to each other properly. Then I began having issues with
misusing malloc by using it when it wasn't really needed. After sorting that out it took me a second to notice the ascii value i wanted to work with
was the blue number on the chart not the red one. Then getting the format for writing to the output file was a lil tricky and isn't very clean. Then
I spent a very long time trying to figure out how to get rid of the extra random characters when the input file is longer like reading.txt. hello.txt
works perfectly. Yeah I'm kinda running out of time so this may be the best that it gets.
