================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	4H 0M
Plan:
I'm assuming that this will be like the fileIO assignment and will mostly be reading about lstat a lil bit,
followed by toying around with it to get used to it then using it to fulfill the assignment.

Complete
Actual Time	3H 0M
Observations:
At this point I've noticed that I expect things to take longer than they usually do. As for how it went, well
it went pretty much the way I expected with the one real obstacle being figuring out that I needed the bitwise
and operator rather than the normal boolean one.
