Start
Estimated Time	5H 0M
Plan:
Go over the file IO functions that will be used to get a base understanding, then start toying around with them in c
to get used to them in practice, then implement them so that they work the way I need them to.

Complete
Actual Time	3H 30M
Observations:
The only real obstacles I ran into were figuring out how to look at what was read and how to assign what is written.
I solved this by looking at some basic examples online and learning that is what the buffer is. After that I just had
to smooth out a coupe weird bugs I was having.
