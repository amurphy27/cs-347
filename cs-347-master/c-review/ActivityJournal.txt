Start
Estimated Time	8H 0M
Plan:
Read through the assignment and look through notes on pointers since it has been a while since I have used c
Then go through the functions in order

Complete
Actual Time	9H 30M
Observations:
I was very rusty with my knowledge of C, so I looked over some tutorials on pointers and asked my friend in who has already taken this class
to give me a run down on what * means when it is used in different places. I only did these things after struggling for about 5 hours on the
second function so I probably should have done these things sooner. I get warnings for comparing a pointer to a integer (NULL) twice in the
last function but it works and I don't see why I can't see if a pointer is NULL so I'm leaving it as is.
